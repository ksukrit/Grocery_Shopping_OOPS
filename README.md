# OOPS Project Grocery Shopping Website
College OOPS project, frontend in React and backend built using Java. PostgreSQL is the DB used.

# Problems :
* No way to track order status
* No actual payment method
* Password is stored as plaintext instead of using some encoding techniques, also rework change password.
* Redux should be used more in the frontend
* No API/Auth tokens instead using cookie based Spring security
* Need to improve separation of service layer and data access layer methods.
